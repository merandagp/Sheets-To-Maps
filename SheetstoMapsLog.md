# Maps From Google Sheets: Oct 21, 2021

Followed the (Point Map with Google My Maps)[https://handsondataviz.org/mymaps.html] tutorial all the way through, love how easy it is to populate large amounts of data into a map in seconds!(Here)[https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1t7EPJ8ACSowGcVQorFgkAm20zeUpRAFK&usp=sharing] is the map I made. I can definitely see a practical application of this in my own work to visualize places of interest around Mechanicsville that were either mentioned in my newspaper research or oral history interviews. 

Only started running into issues on the last step and embedding the map with HTML through a markdown file and github pages. The map never showed up when I just included the iframe bit or when I tried to code it as a link as I would normally in markdown. Asked the discord for help! I don’t anticipate using markdown and github pages in the future though so not a huge roadblock for me moving forward, just frustrating. I feel like I don’t have a strong enough grasp of markdown and github to fully appreciate their capabilities, they just trip me up. 

Went on to make a more Ottawa/Mechanicsville specific map for more practice that can be seen (here)[https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=12_u9T0Thsoca55b5ypTXF5dp3Ug6BIr3&usp=sharing].
